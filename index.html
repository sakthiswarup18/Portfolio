      <h4>Personalized AI-Driven Cybersecurity Response System for IoT Devices</h4>
      <span>Published | University of Massachusetts Dartmouth</span>
      <p>
        This research explores a new AI-driven cybersecurity approach for IoT devices, focusing on personalized security responses based on user behavior. 
        Traditional security models struggle with high false positives and evolving cyber threats, making them inefficient in dynamic IoT environments. 
        Our study proposes an adaptive, behavior-based security system that learns individual usage patterns to detect anomalies and respond to threats in real time.
      </p>
      <h5>Key Highlights:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyzes limitations of traditional rule-based security models for IoT.</li>
        <li>Introduces an AI-driven security system that adapts to unique user behaviors.</li>
        <li>Utilizes behavioral modeling, anomaly detection, and federated learning.</li>
        <li>Reduces false alarms while increasing threat detection accuracy.</li>
        <li>Explores privacy-preserving techniques through on-device AI learning.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Impact and Applications:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Enhances real-time cybersecurity in smart homes, healthcare, and industrial IoT.</li>
        <li>Reduces over-reliance on predefined threat databases, improving detection accuracy.</li>
        <li>Provides scalable, adaptive security for billions of IoT devices.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Future Research Directions:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Developing lightweight AI models for low-power IoT devices.</li>
        <li>Integrating blockchain-based authentication for decentralized security.</li>
        <li>Refining federated learning techniques for privacy-preserving model training.</li>
